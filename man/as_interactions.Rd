\description{
\code{as_interactions} transforms a vector in an interactions matrix object defining the positive and negative interactions between populations.
The interaction is not assumed symetrical, so a population can have a different effect on a population than this latest has on the first one.
The interaction of a population on itself is equal to 0. If no interaction vector is given, the default values are 0.
See \code{\link[BeePODYNA]{interactions}} function to create a new interaction matrix from scratch.
If the object is of the type \code{numeric}, it should be a vector of numeric of length \code{nb_pop*(nb_pop-1)} giving the interaction of each population on the other one.
Each interaction is a decimal ranging between -1 and 1. A positive value means a positive impact like facilitation while a negative value means a negative impact like predation, competition.
The vector starts with the vector of the interactions of the first population on the other ones ranging from 2 to the last one, not including itself,
and then the vector of the interactions of the second population on the others...
