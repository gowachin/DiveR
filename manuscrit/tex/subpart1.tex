\section{Adding R code}

As R \citep{RTeam2017} is commonly used in this master, there is the possibily to paste directly R code and input it inside the document. It is important to note that long lines are broken and it is signaled with line numbers on the left part of the script.

\begin{lstlisting}
# this is a random function taken out from a master project. code won't run
hudson_lotka <- beepodyna(label = "hudson_lotka", community = hudson, interactions = hudson_int,
  functions = c(lotka_prey,lotka_pred), verbose = TRUE)

jpeg("figure/lotka.jpg", width = 802, height = 445)
plot(simulate_n_pop_dynamic(hudson_lotka,10)$community, col = c("tan3","slateblue3"),
     pch = c(1,2), xlim = c(1910,1930), ylim = c(0,100))
legend("bottomright", c("hare","lynx"),col = c("tan3","slateblue3"), pch = c(1,2))
graphics.off()
