# Template

Compendium template for all projects ever to submit anywhere. 

It's a R package, with sweave files, datas, vignettes for packages and all stuff to write down great work from Rstudio.

## To do : 

- do a brand new Sweave to merge the Master_report.tex file and some good chunks
- create different styles for sweave
- expose a correct sweave for saving .RData (see Markov file)


Feel free to fork this, and use it. Any recommendation is welcome :)
