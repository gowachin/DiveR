R package for dive planification tools. It contains functions and methods to represent dive curves, desaturation time and gas consumption. At this day, only mn90 tables models are coded for single, consecutive or successive dives. This mean all profile are square ones and only maximum depth and dive time are used to compute desaturation.

**The shiny application is not yet in production.**

Future parts are work in progress, like more precise planification setup with different depths and time input. Desaturation planification with other models are also planned along with maybe other gas than air supported for consumption.

Intended to be used by french dive student, traduction of the lexic is on it's way.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{DiveR}` from [github](https://github.com/gowachin/DiveR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/gowachin/DiveR')
# or 
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gowachin/DiveR")
```
<!--
## Usage

### Planning a single dive

Apart from default/advanced settings, a dive can be resumed by it's maximum depth and duration. For example, here is the default dive for this pacakge, a maximum depth at 20 meters for 40 minutes. Note here that despite going underwater at an altitude of -20, we use positive numeric values.

dive(20,40)

### Planning a second dive

A second dive depends heavily on the first one as the desaturation is not perfect and residual azote will impact the second saturation. 

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->

## Disclaimer 
This application is intended for use in education about scubadiving planification and academic interest only. It is not designed for actual use in scuba diving and underwater activity. It is emphatically not suitable for use in actual diving. Scuba diving is a dangerous activity with risks of death and serious injury. No-one should attempt scuba diving without training, certification, supervision and regular medical assessment. It is also dangerous for trained scuba divers to exceed the limitations of their training. 

This application will provide planinfication about dive profile and air consumption, without giving any warning if the activity would be dangerous or fatal. In doing so, it does not take account of safety restrictions, other physical laws, or other important information. 
Despite using diving table as base for computation, no output from this application should be misconstrued as a diving table. The author does not warrant that the application is correct in any sense whatsoever. Even if correctly computed, the predictions of a theoretical physical model may not be correct predictions.

Note here that all dives simulated will also being at sea level.

## Actual in work part

Refactorisation of Consumption, plot.conso for multi tank dives.

## To do : 

- Complete README with examples
- Redaction of vignettes
- doc on new conso and dive functions
- make a beautiful doc for every functions
- desaturation with complex models

## Doc in work (mostly missing examples) :

- attributes
summary.dive

- conso
bloc

conso

- deco

dtcurve

- graphics
